Traditional image-level data augmentation has shown the potential to improve sample efficiency in various machine learning tasks. However, image-level data augmentation is insufficient for an imitation learning agent to learn good manipulation policies in a reasonable amount of demonstrations. We propose Simulation-augmented Equivariant Imitation Learning (SEIL), a method that combines a novel data augmentation strategy of supplementing expert trajectories with simulated transitions and an equivariant model that exploits the $\\mathbf{O}(2)$ symmetry in robotic manipulation. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method can learn non-trivial manipulation tasks within ten demonstrations and outperforms the baselines with a significant margin.\nApproach 1.

We also get a modified version monoVO-Python here as our baseline, where we also add out kitti toolkits. Our project is ORBSLAM3 on iPhone. The motivation is that SLAM often requires cameras like realsense, which is hard to get in daily life. So, why not use the camera in our iPhone? By using iPhone, many interesting applications can be furtherly extended, such as augmented reality, indoor localization, etc. For now, the ORBSLAM algorithm runs on PC and the video sequence is transmitting from iPhone to PC via droidcam.\nPlease refer to our project website!\n","date":1651017600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651017600,"objectID":"4a2c1c3c50f8c08de1fb1f115c0dd211","permalink":"https://saulbatman.github.io/project/orbslam/","publishdate":"2022-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/orbslam/","section":"project","summary":"Wanna try ORBSLAM3 with your iPhone?
