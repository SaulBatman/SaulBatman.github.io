## Who am I
My name is Mingxi Jia. I am a M.S. in Robotics student at Northeastern University, Boston. Before Northeastern, I was a research assistant at BNU-HKBU United International College, working on learning-based object 3D reconstruction, visual-aided robot arm, etc. And, I received my Bachelor of Engineering (in Mechanical Engineering) degree at Beijing University of Chemical Technology. **I am currently looking for a Ph.D. position in robotics now. Please feel free to contact me via my email (jia dot ming at northeastern dot edu)!**

## Why I love robotics?
In one sentence, I LOVE IRON MAN! The robot arm, controlled by Starkâ€™s voice through a intelligent agent Jarvis, collaborate naturally with Tony in engineering tasks and also domestic tasks. It exacly describes my vision of robotics.
