## Who am I
My name is Mingxi Jia, a Ph.D. student in [Humans To Robots (H2R) Laboratory](https://h2r.cs.brown.edu/) at Brown, advised by Prof. Stefanie Tellex. Before joining the H2R lab, I was fortunate to work with Prof. Robert Platt, Prof. Robin Walters at Northeastern University, Prof. Amy Zhang, Prof. Haipeng Guo at BNU-HKBU UIC, and Prof. Qing Guo at BUCT. 

<!-- I was a research assistant at BNU-HKBU United International College, working on learning-based object 3D reconstruction, visual-aided robot arm, etc. -->
<!-- ## Why I love robotics?
In one sentence, I LOVE IRON MAN! The robot arm, controlled by Starkâ€™s voice through an intelligent agent Jarvis, collaborates naturally with Tony in engineering and domestic tasks. It exacly describes my vision of robotics. -->
